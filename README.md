# DiscordJs Example Bot
A DiscordJs Example Bot to help you create Discord Bots!

## Directory Information
There are two directories for the bots:
- Single File
- Cmd Handler (Work In Progress)

The "Single File" bot is pretty self-explanatory. It's a bot that runs on one file. Recommended for beginners to programming or specifically to bot making.
The "Cmd Handler" bot is more complex. It's a bot that has it's commands separated into different files. Recommended for more experienced programmers.
